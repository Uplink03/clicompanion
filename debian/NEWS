clicompanion (1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

    CLI Companion uses a new format to store its commands. If you stored
    commands in the old format you will need to migrate them to the new
    format in order to use your commands with this and future versions of
    CLI Companion. The new format uses ? as a place holder for User Input
    required at command run time -- i.e. command 'ls <directory>' would now be
    added to the Command List as ls ?. If you have questions additional information
    can be found by going to Help --> Help in the application. You can also file
    a Launchpad Question at https://answers.launchpad.net/clicompanion
