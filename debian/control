Description: run terminal commands from a GUI storing commands for later use
 CLI Companion is an application that is used as a complement to the Terminal.
 .
 People unfamiliar with the Terminal will find CLI Companion a useful
 way to become acquainted with the Terminal. Using the built-in
 commands new users can unlock the potential of the Terminal.
 .
 Experienced users can use CLI Companion’s add command feature to
 build a command dictionary.  Store commands as you come across them,
 and no more do you have to search for them.
