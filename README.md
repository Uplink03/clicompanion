## Credits

Original work by Duane Hinnen on Launchpad.net: [https://launchpad.net/clicompanion]()

Ported to GTK3 manually by Radu Cristescu on a euphoric night on 2024-11-17. It was quite fun. Annoying, because the
Internet is very helpful and PyGTK documentation even less so, but still very fun.

## Licence

Originally licensed under GPL v3 by Duane Hinnen. He did not add a LICENSE file, but he did set the licence property on
Launchpad. I have added the corresponding file to the repository to make things clearer.
